## 🎯 Project Goal
To empower farmers and policymakers with data-driven yield predictions for smarter agricultural planning.

---

## 🧠 How It Works
1. The system takes key environmental and soil parameters as input.  
2. Preprocessing cleans and normalizes data to ensure high model accuracy.  
3. A **Random Forest Regressor** predicts the yield for the selected crop and season.  
4. Results are displayed along with data visualizations for better understanding.

## 🌾 Dashboard Overview

The Smart Crop Yield Predictor dashboard has four main sections:

1️⃣ Predict Yield – Allows users to enter crop details and get AI-based yield predictions using a trained Random Forest model.

2️⃣ Visualization – Displays charts like crop vs yield, rainfall vs yield, and correlations to understand key trends and patterns.

3️⃣ Download Report – Lets users download the prediction and analysis report for future reference or sharing.

4️⃣ Crop Suggestion Helper – Suggests the best crops to grow based on selected state and season, helping with smart farming decisions.
