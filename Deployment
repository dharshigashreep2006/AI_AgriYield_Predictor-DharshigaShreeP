## 🌾 Dashboard Overview — Smart Crop Yield Predictor

The web dashboard is designed with **four main interactive sections**, each serving a distinct purpose to help users analyze, predict, and plan for better agricultural outcomes.


---


### 🧠 **1️⃣ Predict Yield**

This section allows users to **predict the crop yield** based on specific inputs.

* Users can enter details such as crop name, season, area, rainfall, fertilizer, and pesticide usage.
* Once the inputs are filled, the trained **machine learning model (Random Forest Regressor)** predicts the **expected yield value**.
* The output helps farmers or planners estimate productivity for different crop scenarios.

✅ *Purpose:* To provide **real-time AI-based yield prediction** using trained data.

---

### 📊 **2️⃣ Visualization**

This section focuses on **exploring insights and patterns** in the dataset visually.

* Displays key graphs like:

  * Crop vs Average Yield
  * Correlation Heatmap between rainfall, fertilizer, pesticide, and yield
  * Crop distribution and seasonal yield comparison
* Helps users quickly understand which factors have the most impact on yield.

✅ *Purpose:* To give a **visual understanding of trends and data relationships** in the agricultural dataset.

---

### 📑 **3️⃣ Download Report**

This feature allows users to **download a detailed report** of the analysis or predictions made.

* Users can generate a summary report in PDF or CSV format.
* The report contains key metrics, insights, and predictions for record-keeping or sharing.

✅ *Purpose:* To make the results **portable and shareable** for farmers, researchers, or policymakers.

---

### 🌿 **4️⃣ Crop Suggestion Helper**

This is a **smart recommendation system** that suggests the best crops to grow.

* Users can select their **State** and **Season** from the dropdown.
* The system uses dataset insights to suggest crops **best suited for the given region and season**.
* It helps promote **data-driven crop planning** and reduce agricultural risks.

✅ *Purpose:* To guide farmers with **personalized crop recommendations** based on state and season.
